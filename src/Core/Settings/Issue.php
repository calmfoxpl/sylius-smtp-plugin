 * Something wrong with the settings, named by a code rather than a sentence.

 * administrator reads. That split is why there is a code here and not a message: a sentence in
 * this file could never be translated, and a shopkeeper reading an English warning about their
 * Polish shop's mail settings is a warning half ignored.
 *
 * An error means we would not even get as far as a connection, so there is nothing to test yet.
 * A warning means the settings are usable but very probably not what was meant.
