/**
 * Turns one observation into a verdict, given everything observed before it.
 *
 * Three things can be observed: a check of the connection, a real message that went out, and a
 * real message that did not. The last two matter most — a shop whose order confirmations are
 * failing is broken whatever a connection test says — and a successful send is the strongest
 * evidence there is, so it clears the record.
 *
 * All of it is arithmetic over timestamps, with the clock passed in. That is what makes "stays
 * quiet for a single timeout, speaks up for a refused password, forgets it all when the password
 * is corrected" a set of tests rather than a hope.
