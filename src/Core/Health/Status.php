/**
 * Three states, and the difference between the middle two is the whole design.
 *
 * `warn` is what a single failure earns. Mail servers have bad minutes: a rate limit at noon, a
 * provider restarting a node, a connection that timed out once. A module that shouted at every
 * one of those would be muted inside a week, and then the day the API key is revoked nobody
 * would look. So a first failure is recorded and shown, and only a failure that persists — or
 * one that plainly needs a human, like a refused password — becomes `fail` and speaks up.
