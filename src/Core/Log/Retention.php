 * How long the log is kept, and how much of a message goes into it.

 * Both answers are about restraint. A shop's outgoing mail contains names, addresses, order
 * contents and the occasional password reset link, so keeping all of it for ever is a liability
 * dressed up as a feature: it is personal data in a table nobody remembers is there. The
 * defaults are therefore short, storing the body is a deliberate choice, and a resend is only
 * possible while the body is still there — which the panel says plainly rather than offering a
 * button that fails.
