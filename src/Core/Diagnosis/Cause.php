 * Why sending is not working, in the shopkeeper's terms rather than the protocol's.

 * "535 5.7.8" is the truth but not an answer. Each of these causes maps to one sentence in the
 * panel and, where we can, to one thing to do about it — and they are deliberately coarse: a
 * cause that cannot be acted on differently from its neighbour should not be its own cause.
 *
 * The list is complete on purpose: the panel is tested for having a sentence for every entry,
 * so a new cause cannot reach an administrator as an empty red box.
