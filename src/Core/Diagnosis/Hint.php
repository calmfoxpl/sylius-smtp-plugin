/**
 * The sentence after the diagnosis: not what went wrong, but the thing that is usually wrong
 * when it goes wrong at this provider.
 *
 * A refused password means something different at every provider. At Amazon it is nearly always
 * AWS keys pasted where SMTP credentials belong; at Google it is the account password instead
 * of an App password; at Microsoft it is a switch that is off by default; at Mailgun it is a
 * domain in the European region dialled on the global host. Knowing the provider turns a dead
 * end into one thing to go and check.
 *
 * Hints are never certainties, and the panel wording keeps them that way — "most often", not
 * "the problem is".
