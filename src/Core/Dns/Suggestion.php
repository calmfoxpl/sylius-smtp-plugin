/**
 * What the domain's own records suggest, and where each part of it came from.
 *
 * The source travels with the suggestion because it decides how firmly the panel may put it. A
 * submission service published in DNS is the domain's own answer about its own mail, so it can
 * be offered as one; a provider inferred from an SPF include is a guess about intent — the shop
 * may authorise three services and mean a fourth — so it is offered as a question.
 *
 * Nothing here ever carries a credential. DNS can say which service a domain uses; it cannot say
 * who the shop is at that service, and a suggestion that filled in a login would be inventing
 * one.
