 * Which domain the records are about.
 *
 * Not the mail server's domain — the sender's. A shop sending as `zamowienia@sklep.pl` through
 * `smtp-relay.brevo.com` is judged by what `sklep.pl` publishes, because that is the domain a
 * receiving server checks the message against. Getting this backwards would mean checking
 * Brevo's own records, which are always fine and tell nobody anything.
 *
 * The forced sender comes first because it is the address every message will actually carry;
 * the envelope sender next, because that is what receivers see in `MAIL FROM`; and the login
 * last, since at most providers it happens to be an address at the shop's own domain.
