/**
 * What each provider expects a customer's domain to publish.
 *
 * Every value here was checked against live DNS rather than taken from memory, because the cost
 * of being wrong is asymmetric: a wrong include turns into "your domain does not authorise your
 * provider" shown to somebody whose setup is perfectly fine, and a warning that cries wolf is
 * worse than no warning. Three of the first guesses were wrong — SMTP2GO is `spf.smtp2go.com`
 * and not `_spf.smtp2go.com`, SparkPost is the bare `sparkpostmail.com`, and Resend has no
 * include of its own at all because it sends through Amazon.
 *
 * DKIM is deliberately thin. A selector can only be looked up if it is known in advance, and
 * most providers mint a random one per domain — Amazon and Postmark among them. Where that is
 * the case there is no selector here and no DKIM verdict at all, because the absence of a name
 * we guessed proves nothing about the shop. The four that are listed use a fixed selector, which
 * is documented and was confirmed in DNS.
