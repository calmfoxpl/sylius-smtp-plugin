/**
 * Asks the sender domain whether the provider the shop is configured to use is actually allowed
 * to send as it.
 *
 * This is the half of the module that the connection check cannot do. A refused password makes
 * itself known within the quarter hour; a domain that never authorised its new provider sends
 * perfectly happily for weeks while Gmail quietly files everything under spam, and the shop's
 * own test message — sent to a colleague at the same domain — arrives beautifully. That is the
 * failure this exists for.
 *
 * It follows one level of nesting, because agencies and hosting companies routinely put their
 * own record in the middle (`include:_spf.agency.pl` which in turn includes the provider), and
 * stopping at the first level would report a perfectly good setup as broken. It stops there
 * rather than recursing to the end for the same reason receivers do: RFC 7208 allows ten
 * lookups in total, and a checker that spends more than a receiver would is measuring something
 * the receiver never sees.
