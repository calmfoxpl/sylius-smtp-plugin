/**
 * Whether to interrupt somebody's afternoon.
 *
 * The rules are short and they are all about trust. Report a failure once, when it is first
 * called a failure. Report it again if the reason changes, because "the password is refused" and
 * "the port is closed" are different jobs. Repeat it after a long silence, because a shop that
 * has not sent an order confirmation since Tuesday deserves a second knock. And say when it is
 * over, because a warning nobody is told the end of is a warning that gets ignored next time.
 *
 * Everything else is silence. In particular a single failed check is never reported: the
 * evaluator keeps it at `warn`, and `warn` lives in the panel, not in somebody's inbox.
