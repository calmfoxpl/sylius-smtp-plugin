 * What one check of the connection found.

 * Deliberately more than a yes or a no: the stage, the cause, the server's own words and how
 * long it took. The panel shows all four, because "we could not log in" plus the server's
 * `535 5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` is a report a hosting company can act on,
 * while a red light is a second ticket.
 *
 * It says nothing about delivery. A server that accepts a connection and a password can still
 * drop the message, and a check that claimed otherwise would be the kind of green light that
 * costs somebody a day of orders.
