/**
 * The providers a Magento shop is actually sent through, and one entry for "a server of my own".
 *
 * Two of them are deliberately marked as a poor fit for a shop rather than left out: Gmail and
 * Microsoft 365. People pick them because the address already exists, and they are the two that
 * reliably fall over on the first busy day, when a mailbox meant for correspondence is asked to
 * send several hundred order confirmations. Saying so in the panel is kinder than letting the
 * daily limit say it.
 *
 * Ports are the ones the providers document today: 587 with STARTTLS almost everywhere, which
 * is also the port least likely to be blocked outbound by a hosting company.
