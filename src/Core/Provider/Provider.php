/**
 * One e-mail provider, described well enough that nobody has to open a second browser tab.
 *
 * A preset is not only a host and a port. Most support tickets about SMTP are about the two
 * credential fields, because every provider means something different by them: SendGrid wants
 * the literal word `apikey` as the login, Postmark wants the same token twice, Amazon wants
 * credentials that look like AWS keys but are not. So the hints travel with the preset and are
 * shown next to the fields they describe, and where a provider has a habit of biting people —
 * a daily limit, a switch that has to be turned on first — that is written down as a caveat
 * rather than left for the shopkeeper to discover on the day of a sale.
 *
 * Hosts stay editable. A preset that guesses the wrong region is a starting point, not a cage.
