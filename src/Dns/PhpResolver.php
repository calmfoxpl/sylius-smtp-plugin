/**
 * DNS through the system resolver, which is the only one a shop is guaranteed to have.
 *
 * `dns_get_record()` takes no timeout: it inherits whatever `/etc/resolv.conf` says, which is
 * commonly five seconds and two attempts. That is the reason this class is never called while a
 * page is being rendered — the button, the cron job and the console command call it, and
 * everything else reads the answer they stored. A resolver with a proper timeout would need a
 * dependency and a socket of its own, which is a poor trade for a check that runs four times a
 * day.
 *
 * A record that does not exist and a nameserver that will not answer come back differently on
 * purpose: the first is an empty array and a finding, the second is an exception and an admission.
